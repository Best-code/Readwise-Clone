<h2 class='sectionHeading'>INTRODUCTION</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 7 &middot; Location 326</div><div class='noteText'>Good habits are important , but it’s often our bad habits that prevent us from reaching our full potential . You can have all the good habits in the world , but if you keep doing the bad habits alongside the good ones , you’ll struggle to reach your goals . Think of it this way : you’re only as good as your worst habits .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>WHAT IS MENTAL STRENGTH?</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 347</div><div class='noteText'>There are several factors at play to determine the ease at which you develop mental strength :</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 348</div><div class='noteText'>Genetics —</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 350</div><div class='noteText'>Personality —</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 351</div><div class='noteText'>Experiences —</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 10 &middot; Location 358</div><div class='noteText'>The less he speaks with his coworkers , the less they initiate conversation with him . When he enters the break room and passes people in the hallway without anyone speaking to him , he thinks , I must be socially awkward . The more he thinks about how awkward he is , the more nervous he feels about starting conversations . As his anxiety increases , his desire to avoid his coworkers also increases . This results in a self - perpetuating cycle .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 10 &middot; Location 364</div><div class='noteText'>Thoughts — Identifying irrational thoughts and replacing them with more realistic thoughts .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 10 &middot; Location 365</div><div class='noteText'>Behaviors — Behaving in a positive manner despite the circumstances .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 11 &middot; Location 369</div><div class='noteText'>CHOOSE BEHAVIOR BASED ON BALANCED EMOTIONS AND RATIONAL THINKING</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 11 &middot; Location 375</div><div class='noteText'>We make our best decisions in life when we balance our emotions with rational thinking .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 12 &middot; Location 387</div><div class='noteText'>Mental strength doesn’t require you to ignore your emotions . Increasing your mental strength isn’t about suppressing your emotions ; instead it’s about developing a keen awareness of them . It’s about interpreting and understanding how your emotions influence your thoughts and behavior .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 12 &middot; Location 389</div><div class='noteText'>You don’t have to treat your body like a machine to be mentally strong . Mental strength isn’t about pushing your body to its physical limits just to prove you can ignore pain . It’s about understanding your thoughts and feelings well enough that you can determine when to behave contrary to them , and when to listen to them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 12 &middot; Location 396</div><div class='noteText'>Being mentally strong is not about positive thinking . Thinking overly positive thoughts can be just as detrimental as thinking overly negative thoughts . Mental strength is about thinking realistically and rationally .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 398</div><div class='noteText'>Developing mental strength isn’t about chasing happiness . Being mentally strong will help you to be more content in life , but it isn’t about waking up every day and trying to force yourself to feel happy . Instead , it’s about making the decisions that will help you reach your full potential .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER 1: THEY DON’T WASTE TIME FEELING SORRY FOR THEMSELVES</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 18 &middot; Location 458</div><div class='noteText'>She encouraged his parents to stop feeling sorry for Jack . She recommended they treat him like a mentally and physically tough kid who was capable of overcoming great adversity .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 486</div><div class='noteText'>Even when you can’t alter your circumstances , you can alter your attitude .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 19 &middot; Location 493</div><div class='noteText'>As long as you feel sorry for yourself , you can delay any circumstances that will bring you face - to - face with your real fears , and you can avoid taking any responsibility for your actions . Feeling sorry for yourself can buy time . Instead of taking action or moving forward , exaggerating how bad your situation is justifies why you shouldn’t do anything to improve it .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 516</div><div class='noteText'>It can become a self - fulfilling prophecy . Feelings of self - pity can lead to living a pitiful life . When you feel sorry for yourself , it’s unlikely you’ll perform at your best . As a result , you may experience more problems and increased failures , which will breed more feelings of self - pity .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 520</div><div class='noteText'>self - pity keeps the focus on why things should be different rather than accepting the situation for what it is .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 526</div><div class='noteText'>No one ever says , “ What I really like about her is the fact that she always feels sorry for herself . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 550</div><div class='noteText'>Our choice to spend the day doing something enjoyable isn’t about ignoring our grief or masking our sadness . It’s about making a conscious choice to celebrate life’s gifts and refusing to behave in a pitiful manner .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 556</div><div class='noteText'>Volunteer to help a worthy cause . It will take your mind off your problems and you can feel good that you’ve helped support someone else . It’s hard to feel sorry for yourself when you’re serving hungry people in a soup kitchen or spending time with elderly residents in a nursing home . • Perform a random act of kindness . Whether you mow the neighbor’s lawn or donate pet food to a local animal shelter , doing a good deed can help bring more meaning to your day . • Do something active . Physical or mental activity will help you focus on something other than your misfortune . Exercise , sign up for a class , read a book , or learn a new hobby , and your behavior change can help shift your attitude .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 564</div><div class='noteText'>If what you’re doing now isn’t working , try something new . If you never take a step in the right direction , you’ll stay right where you are .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 607</div><div class='noteText'>EXCHANGE SELF - PITY FOR GRATITUDE</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 624</div><div class='noteText'>Start to acknowledge other people’s kindness and generosity . Affirm the good in the world and you will begin to appreciate what you have .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER 2: THEY DON’T GIVE AWAY THEIR POWER</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 38 &middot; Location 761</div><div class='noteText'>Anytime you don’t set healthy emotional and physical boundaries for yourself , you risk giving away your power to other people .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 817</div><div class='noteText'>Choosing to forgive someone who has hurt you , either emotionally or physically , doesn’t mean you have to excuse the other person’s behavior , but letting go of your anger frees you to focus your energy on a more worthwhile cause .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 824</div><div class='noteText'>stop giving people your time and energy if you don’t want them to play a big role in your life .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 846</div><div class='noteText'>Make a conscious choice to think about how you want to behave before you react to other people . Every time you lose your cool , you give that other person your power .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 849</div><div class='noteText'>Take deep breaths . Frustration and anger cause physical reactions within the body — an increased rate of breathing , an elevated heart rate , and sweating to name a few . Taking slow , deep breaths can relax your muscles and decrease the physiological response , which in turn can decrease your emotional reactivity . • Excuse yourself from the situation . The more emotional you feel , the less rational you’ll think . Learn to recognize your personal warning signs of anger — such as shaking or feeling flushed — and remove yourself from the situation before you lose your cool . This may mean saying , “ I am not willing to talk about that right now , ” or it may mean walking away .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 855</div><div class='noteText'>Distract yourself . Don’t try solving a problem or addressing an issue with someone when you’re feeling overly emotional . Instead , distract yourself with an activity , like walking or reading , to help you calm down . Getting your mind off what’s bothering you , even for a few minutes , can help you calm down so you can think more rationally .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 868</div><div class='noteText'>successful people don’t allow one person’s opinion to define them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 869</div><div class='noteText'>While criticism can sometimes open our eyes to how others perceive us so we can make positive change — a friend points out a bad habit , or a spouse helps you see your selfish behavior — at other times , criticism is a reflection of the critic .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 871</div><div class='noteText'>Angry people may choose to offer harsh criticism quite regularly just because it relieves their stress . Or individuals with low self - esteem may feel better about themselves only when they put other people down . So it’s important to really consider the source before making any decisions about how you want to proceed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 47 &middot; Location 893</div><div class='noteText'>Simply reminding yourself that you have a choice in everything you do , think , and feel can be very freeing .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 48 &middot; Location 911</div><div class='noteText'>You’ll develop a better sense of who you are when you’re able to make choices based on what’s best for you instead of what will prevent the most repercussions . • When you take responsibility for your own behavior , you’ll become accountable for your progress toward your goals . • You will never be pressured into doing something that you don’t want to do based on guilt trips or what you think other people want you to do . • You’ll be able to devote your time and energy to things you choose . You won’t have to blame other people for wasting your time or ruining your day . • Retaining your personal power reduces your risk of depression , anxiety , and other mental health issues . Many mental health problems are linked to a sense of hopelessness and helplessness . When you decide not to give other people and external circumstances the power to control how you feel and behave , you gain more power over your mental health .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 49 &middot; Location 921</div><div class='noteText'>When you hold a grudge , those feelings of anger and resentment do nothing to lessen the other person’s life . Instead , harboring anger and resentment gives that person more power to interfere with your quality of life . Choosing to forgive allows you to take back your power ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 932</div><div class='noteText'>You don’t have any control over whether someone will apologize .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 933</div><div class='noteText'>Waiting to forgive people until they say they’re sorry gives them control over not just your life , but perhaps even your death .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER 3: THEY DON’T SHY AWAY FROM CHANGE</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 53 &middot; Location 970</div><div class='noteText'>change too much too fast , which is a recipe for failure .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1068</div><div class='noteText'>Many people associate change with discomfort . And often , they underestimate their ability to tolerate the discomfort that accompanies a behavioral change .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 1085</div><div class='noteText'>Staying the same often equals getting stuck in a rut . Life can get pretty boring if you don’t do anything differently . A person who simply decides to keep things as mundane and low - key as possible isn’t likely to experience a rich , full life and might become depressed .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 1099</div><div class='noteText'>The longer you wait the harder it gets . Do you think it’s easier to quit smoking after your first cigarette or after twenty years of smoking ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 1102</div><div class='noteText'>The longer change gets delayed , the harder it is to do .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 64 &middot; Location 1141</div><div class='noteText'>There’s no need to change for the sake of change .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 1175</div><div class='noteText'>some of the best things in life come from our ability to conquer a challenge through hard work .</h3>

Sometimes people try to change everything all at once .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 67 &middot; Location 1190</div><div class='noteText'>Anticipate obstacles along the way . Make a plan for how you will respond to specific challenges that you’re likely to encounter . Planning ahead can help you stay on track .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1355</div><div class='noteText'>Being a control freak damages relationships . Telling people what they should do or how to do things right isn’t likely to attract many friends . In fact , many who have control issues struggle to get close to people because they don’t trust others with any type of responsibility . • You’ll judge others harshly . If you credit all your success in life to your abilities , you’ll criticize people who haven’t achieved the same . In fact , people with a high internal locus of control tend to suffer from loneliness because they feel irritable that other people aren’t keeping up with their standards . • You’ll unnecessarily blame yourself for everything . You can’t prevent bad things from happening all the time . But , if you think everything is within your control , you’ll believe you’re directly responsible every time life doesn’t go according to your plan .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 1371</div><div class='noteText'>To achieve this balance in your own life , be willing to examine your beliefs about what you truly can control and what you can’t .

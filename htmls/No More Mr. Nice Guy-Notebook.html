<h2 class='sectionHeading'>New Preface from the Author</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 10 &middot; Location 97</div><div class='noteText'>Throughout the years since , my ongoing mantra has been , “ I love waking up in the morning not knowing how my day is going to end . ” I have discovered that when people let go of the inaccurate roadmaps they developed in childhood and begin searching for more helpful life paradigms , they open the door for an amazing adventure .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 11 &middot; Location 102</div><div class='noteText'>Learning to self - soothe is every bit as important as learning to release toxic shame .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Introduction</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 131</div><div class='noteText'>Nice Guys believe that if they are good , giving , and caring , they will in return be happy , loved , and fulfilled . Sound too good to be true ? It is .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER ONE: The Nice Guy Syndrome</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 252</div><div class='noteText'>Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers . Many Nice Guys report having unavailable , absent , passive , angry , philandering , or alcoholic fathers . It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 335</div><div class='noteText'>Nice Guys tend to be very black and white in their thinking . The only alternative they can see to being nice is becoming “ bastards ” or “ jerks . ” I frequently remind Nice Guys that the opposite of crazy is still crazy , so becoming a “ jerk ” isn’t the answer .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 340</div><div class='noteText'>Being integrated means being able to accept all aspects of one’s self . An integrated man is able to embrace everything that makes him unique : his power , his assertiveness , his courage , and his passion as well as his imperfections , his mistakes , and his dark side .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 346</div><div class='noteText'>He has integrity . He does what is right , not what is expedient .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 31 &middot; Location 385</div><div class='noteText'>As a child , Jason was too naive and powerless to realize that no matter what he did , he would never live up to his father’s expectations . Similarly , no</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 35 &middot; Location 457</div><div class='noteText'>Why would it seem rational for a person to try to eliminate or hide certain things about himself and try to become something different unless there was a compelling reason for him to do so ? Why do people try to change who they really are ? Take some time and think about this . Is this your behavior or the behavior of someone you know ? chapter TWO THE MAKING OF</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER TWO: The Making Of A Nice Guy</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 38 &middot; Location 503</div><div class='noteText'>Toxic shame is not just a belief that one does bad things , it is a deeply held core belief that one is bad .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 44 &middot; Location 595</div><div class='noteText'>Alan came to believe that he had to be different from his father to be seen as a good man and be loved by his mother .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 596</div><div class='noteText'>Alan and Jason were used and objectified by their parents . They were valued for always doing it “ right ” and never being a problem . This communicated that they were only lovable when they lived up to their parents ’ expectations .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER THREE: Learn To Please Yourself</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 61 &middot; Location 838</div><div class='noteText'>The possibility of availability extends beyond just sex . Since Nice Guys have been conditioned by their families and society to never do anything to upset a woman , they are hyper vigilant in responding to the moods and desires of women they don’t even plan on having sex with . Seeking women’s approval gives women the power to set the tone of the relationship</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 66 &middot; Location 916</div><div class='noteText'>Nice Guys have a difficult time comprehending that in general , people are not drawn to perfection in others . People are drawn to shared interests , shared problems , and an individual’s life energy .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 67 &middot; Location 932</div><div class='noteText'>Do you believe that people can see your human imperfections and still love you ? How would you be different if you knew the people who care about you would never leave you or stop loving you – no matter what ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 69 &middot; Location 978</div><div class='noteText'>As the recovering Nice Guy begins to do good things for himself , he will feel uncomfortable . He may actually feel frightened , anxious , guilty , or confused . These feelings are the result of what is called cognitive dissonance . When the Nice Guy does something good for himself he is doing something that implies he is valuable . This will conflict with his deeply held belief that he is worthless .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER FOUR: Make Your Needs A Priority</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 80 &middot; Location 1133</div><div class='noteText'>Beneath this facade of needlessness and wantlessness , all Nice Guys are actually extremely needy . Consequently , when they go about trying to get their needs met , Nice Guys are frequently indirect , unclear , manipulative , and controlling .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 80 &middot; Location 1136</div><div class='noteText'>In addition to using ineffective strategies to get their needs met , Nice Guys are terrible receivers . Since getting their needs met contradicts their childhood paradigms , Nice Guys are extremely uncomfortable when they actually do get what they want . Though most Nice Guys have a difficult time grasping this concept , they are terrified of getting what they really want and will go to extreme measures to make sure they don’t . Nice Guys carry out this unconscious agenda by connecting with needy or unavailable people , operating from an unspoken agenda , being unclear and indirect , pushing people away , and sabotaging .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 82 &middot; Location 1166</div><div class='noteText'>Ask yourself if you believe it is OK to have needs . Do you believe people want to help you meet your needs ? Do you believe this world is a place of abundance ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 83 &middot; Location 1189</div><div class='noteText'>Reese was so busy caretaking the needs and problems of his boyfriends , he gave up his job and alienated most of his friends and family . Reese’s caretaking allowed him to stay oblivious to his own self - destructive behaviors while investing tremendous energy in trying to fix others . As is true for most Nice Guys , no matter how much he gave to others , Reese never felt like he got as much back in return .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 87 &middot; Location 1258</div><div class='noteText'>Since Nice Guys learned to sacrifice themselves in order to survive , recovery must center on learning to put themselves first and making their needs a priority .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 88 &middot; Location 1262</div><div class='noteText'>“ No one was put on this planet to meet your needs ” ( except their parents — and their job is done ) . I also remind them they weren’t put on this planet to meet anyone else’s needs ( except those of their children ) .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 88 &middot; Location 1277</div><div class='noteText'>Helpless , whiny , wimpy , and needy are not attractive on a man . Confidence and self - assurance are attractive . Most folks are attracted to men who have a sense of self . Putting the self first doesn’t drive people away , it attracts them . Putting the self first is essential for getting what one wants in love and life .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 89 &middot; Location 1280</div><div class='noteText'>In order for Nice Guys to get their needs met , they must begin to shift their core paradigms . This shift includes coming to believe : ■ Having needs is part of being human . ■ Mature people make meeting their own needs a priority . ■ They can ask for help in meeting their needs in clear and direct ways . ■ Other people really do want to help them meet their needs . ■ This world is a place of abundance .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER FIVE: Reclaim Your Personal Power</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 97 &middot; Location 1395</div><div class='noteText'>Personal power isn’t the absence of fear . Even the most powerful people have fear . Personal power is the result of feeling fear , but not giving in to the fear .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 98 &middot; Location 1426</div><div class='noteText'>Instead of asking , “ Why is this happening to me ? ” the recovering Nice Guy can respond to life’s challenges by pondering , “ What do I need to learn from this situation ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 102 &middot; Location 1490</div><div class='noteText'>I frequently tell Nice Guys , “ Your feelings are just feelings , they won’t kill you . ” Regardless of whether a Nice Guy is feeling anxious , helpless , shameful , lonely , rageful , or sad , his feelings aren’t life threatening .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 103 &middot; Location 1492</div><div class='noteText'>The goal of teaching Nice Guys to embrace their feelings is not to make them soft and “ touchy feely . ” Men who are in touch with their feelings are powerful , assertive , and energized .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 104 &middot; Location 1516</div><div class='noteText'>Don’t focus on the other person , “ You are making me mad . ” Instead , take responsibility for what you are feeling , “ I am feeling angry . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 104 &middot; Location 1521</div><div class='noteText'>■ In general , try to begin feeling statements with “ I , ” rather than “ you . ” Try to avoid the crutch of saying “ I feel like . ” As in , “ I feel like you are being mean to me . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 108 &middot; Location 1584</div><div class='noteText'>“ I can handle it . No matter what happens , I will handle it . ” Keep repeating this mantra until you take action and stop feeling fear .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 109 &middot; Location 1604</div><div class='noteText'>In time , they also learn that boundary setting isn’t about getting other people to be different . It’s about getting themselves to be different . If someone is crossing their boundary , it isn’t the other person’s problem ; it is theirs .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 110 &middot; Location 1606</div><div class='noteText'>Because of memory fear , Nice Guys often unconsciously reinforce the very behaviors they find intolerable . Due to their childhood conditioning , they teach the people around them that they will accept having their boundaries violated .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>CHAPTER SIX: Reclaim Your Masculinity</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 119 &middot; Location 1746</div><div class='noteText'>Most women do not want a man who tries to please them — they want a man who knows how to please himself . Women consistently share with me that they don’t want a passive , pleasing wimp . They want a man — someone with his balls still intact .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 119 &middot; Location 1752</div><div class='noteText'>Reclaiming one’s masculinity involves : ■ Connecting with other men ■ Getting strong ■ Finding healthy male role models ■ Reexamining one’s relationship with one’s father</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 124 &middot; Location 1815</div><div class='noteText'>List three men whom you would like to get to know better . Next to each man’s name list a possible activity you could do together . Next to this , write down a date and make a commitment to contact him by this day .</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 144 &middot; Location 2124</div><div class='noteText'>List some of the ways you try to please your partner . What changes would you make if you did not have to worry about making her happy ?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 148 &middot; Location 2178</div><div class='noteText'>Instead of saying “ if she would just . . . , ” the recovering Nice Guy has to ask , “ Why did I need to cocreate this relationship ? ” “ How does this relationship let me play familiar roles ? ” “ How does this relationship let me meet unconscious needs ? ” “ Why did I invite this person into my life ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 149 &middot; Location 2195</div><div class='noteText'>The next time you find yourself feeling frustrated , resentful , or rageful at your partner , ask yourself these questions : “ Why have I invited this person into my life ? ” “ What do I need to learn from this situation ? ” “ How would my view of this situation change if I saw it as a gift ? ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 149 &middot; Location 2206</div><div class='noteText'>Here is the irony for Nice Guys : Nice Guys like the idea of a smooth and problem - free relationship . Typically , if their partner is unhappy , depressed , angry , or having a problem , they will jump right in and try and fix it or make it better . They believe that by doing so , they will make the problem go away and everything will quickly get back to normal . Unfortunately , this is like giving a dog a treat for pissing on the carpet .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 151 &middot; Location 2225</div><div class='noteText'>She responded by telling Joe that she didn’t want him to try to fix her problems and that she liked it better that he had given her some space to work it out on her own .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 152 &middot; Location 2240</div><div class='noteText'>Over time , the members of my No More Mr . Nice Guy groups have come up with a number of traits to consciously look for when creating new relationships . These traits include ( in no particular order ) : ■ Passion ■ Integrity ■ Happiness ■ Intelligence ■ Sexual assertiveness ■ Financial responsibility</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 153 &middot; Location 2256</div><div class='noteText'>Doing something different also means refraining from being sexual in new relationships . Nice Guys must give themselves a chance to accurately evaluate the traits listed above by staying out of bed with a person until they really get to know her . Once the sex begins in relationships , the learning stops . Sex creates such a powerful bond that it is difficult to accurately evaluate the appropriateness of a new relationship .</h3>

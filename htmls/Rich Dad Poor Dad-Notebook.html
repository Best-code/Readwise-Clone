<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Introduction: Rich Dad Poor Dad</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 11 &middot; Location 241</div><div class='noteText'>one dad had a habit of saying , “ I can’t afford it . ” The other dad forbade those words to be used . He insisted I ask , “ How can I afford it ? ” One is a statement , and the other is a question . One lets you off the hook , and the other forces you to think . My soon - to - be - rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “ I can’t afford it , ” your brain stops working . By asking the question “ How can I afford it ? ” your brain is put to work . He did not mean that you should buy everything you want . He was fanatical about exercising your mind , the most powerful computer in the world . He’d say , “ My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it . The stronger it gets , the more money I can make . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 12 &middot; Location 263</div><div class='noteText'>YOUR HOUSE IS NOT AN ASSET The 2008 housing market crash was a clear message that your personal residence is not an asset . Not only does it not put money in your pocket , but we cannot count on the fact that it will go up in value . Many houses in 2017 are still worth less than they were in 2007 .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 277</div><div class='noteText'>I noticed that people really do shape their lives through their thoughts .</h3>

My rich dad , on the other hand , always referred to himself as rich . He would say things like , “ I’m a rich man , and rich people don’t do this . ” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback , he continued to refer to himself as a rich man .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 16 &middot; Location 315</div><div class='noteText'>Money is one form of power .

And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed . First , the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard , and then once we get that paycheck , greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy . The pattern is then set . ”</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 725</div><div class='noteText'>People’s lives are forever controlled by two emotions : fear and greed .

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 42 &middot; Location 784</div><div class='noteText'>Just be an observer , not a reactor , to your emotions .

The donkey’s owner may be going where he wants to , but the donkey is chasing an illusion . Tomorrow there will only be another carrot for the donkey . ”</h3>

To work hard for money , thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel . To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live . To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really living a life . Thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself . That’s cruel , and that’s the trap I want you to avoid . I’ve seen how money runs people’s lives . Don’t let that happen to you . Please don’t let money run your life . ”</h3>

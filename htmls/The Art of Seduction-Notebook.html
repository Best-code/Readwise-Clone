</div><div class='authors'>
Greene, Robert
</div></h1><hr/>

<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Preface</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxi &middot; Location 379</div><div class='noteText'>never be forceful or direct ; instead , use pleasure as bait , playing on people’s emotions , stirring desire and confusion , inducing psychological surrender . In seduction as it is practiced today , the methods of Cleopatra still hold .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxi &middot; Location 412</div><div class='noteText'>nothing will bring you more power in the modern world than the ability to seduce .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxii &middot; Location 421</div><div class='noteText'>Seduction is a game of psychology , not beauty , and it is within the grasp of any person to become a master at the game . All that is required is that you look at the world differently , through the eyes of a seducer .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxii &middot; Location 423</div><div class='noteText'>every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxii &middot; Location 428</div><div class='noteText'>One social or sexual seduction makes the next one easier , your confidence growing and making you more alluring . People are drawn to you in greater numbers as the seducer’s aura descends upon you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxii &middot; Location 437</div><div class='noteText'>Seducers do not improvise ; they do not leave this process to chance . Like any good general , they plan and strategize , aiming at the target’s particular weaknesses .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxii &middot; Location 444</div><div class='noteText'>What will seduce a person is the effort we expend on their behalf , showing how much we care , how much they are worth . Leaving things to chance is a recipe for disaster , and reveals that we do not take love and romance very seriously . It was the effort Casanova expended , the artfulness he applied to each affair that made him so devilishly seductive . Falling in love is a matter not of magic but of psychology . Once you understand your target’s psychology , and strategize to suit it , you will be better able to cast a “ magical ” spell . A seducer sees love not as sacred but as warfare , where all is fair . Seducers are never self - absorbed . Their gaze is directed outward , not inward . When they meet someone their first move is to get inside that person’s skin , to see the world through their eyes .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxiii &middot; Location 466</div><div class='noteText'>A person who enters their lives offering adventure and romance cannot be resisted .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxiii &middot; Location 476</div><div class='noteText'>Seducers take pleasure in performing and are not weighed down by their identity , or by some need to be themselves , or to be natural .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxiv &middot; Location 484</div><div class='noteText'>Seduction is a form of deception , but people want to be led astray , they yearn to be seduced . If they didn’t , seducers would not find so many willing victims . Get rid of any moralizing tendencies , adopt the seducer’s playful philosophy , and you will find the rest of the process easy and natural .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page xxiv &middot; Location 493</div><div class='noteText'>knowing how or why it has happened . It is an art of war for delicate times . Every seduction has two elements that you must analyze and understand : first , yourself and what is seductive about you ; and second , your target and the actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender . The two sides are equally important . If you strategize without paying attention to the parts of your character that draw people to you , you will be seen as a mechanical seducer , slimy and manipulative . If you rely on your seductive personality without paying attention to the other person , you will make terrible mistakes and limit your potential .</h3>
<h2 class='sectionHeading'>Part One: The Seductive Character</h2><h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 3 &middot; Location 528</div><div class='noteText'>Successful seductions rarely begin with an obvious maneuver or strategic device . That is certain to arouse suspicion . Successful seductions begin with your character , your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people and stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Siren &gt; Page 15 &middot; Location 803</div><div class='noteText'>Your gestures must have a certain ambiguity , suggesting something both innocent and erotic . Anything that cannot immediately be understood is supremely seductive , and all the more so if it permeates your manner .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 21 &middot; Location 909</div><div class='noteText'>the Ardent Rake also has the advantage of an uncontrollable libido . When he pursues a woman , he really is aglow with desire ; the victim senses this and is inflamed , even despite herself . How can she imagine that he is a heartless seducer who will abandon her when he so ardently braves all dangers and obstacles to get to her ? And even if she is aware of his rakish past , of his incorrigible amorality , it doesn’t matter , because she also sees his weakness . He cannot control himself ; he actually is a slave to all women . As such he inspires no fear .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 23 &middot; Location 990</div><div class='noteText'>For women the weakness is language and words :</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 24 &middot; Location 995</div><div class='noteText'>The Rake’s use of language is demonic because it is designed not to communicate or convey information but to persuade , flatter , stir emotional turmoil , much as the serpent in the Garden of Eden used words to lead Eve into temptation .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 24 &middot; Location 998</div><div class='noteText'>Remember : it is the form that matters , not the content . The less your targets focus on what you say , and the more on how it makes them feel , the more seductive your effect . Give your words a lofty , spiritual , literary flavor the better to insinuate desire in your unwitting victims .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 24 &middot; Location 1008</div><div class='noteText'>What the Rake offers is what society normally does not allow women : an affair of pure pleasure , an exciting brush with danger . A woman is often deeply oppressed by the role she is expected to play . She is supposed to be the tender , civilizing force in society , and to want commitment and lifelong loyalty .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 25 &middot; Location 1023</div><div class='noteText'>if you are to play the Rake , you must convey a sense of risk and darkness , suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling — a chance to play out her own rakish desires .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 25 &middot; Location 1038</div><div class='noteText'>Remember : if no resistances or obstacles face you , you must create them . No seduction can proceed without them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 26 &middot; Location 1062</div><div class='noteText'>Finally , a Rake’s greatest asset is his reputation . Never downplay your bad name , or seem to apologize for it . Instead , embrace it , enhance it . It is what draws women to you . There are several things you must be known for : your irresistible attractiveness to women ; your uncontrollable devotion to pleasure ( this will make you seem weak , but also exciting to be around ) ; your disdain for convention ; a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 28 &middot; Location 1079</div><div class='noteText'>This might seem to suggest that you should step lightly around husbands and boyfriends , especially early on in your career . But the charm of the Rake is that such dangers don’t matter to them . You cannot be a Rake by being fearful and prudent ; the occasional pummeling is part of the game .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 28 &middot; Location 1086</div><div class='noteText'>accept envy as a badge of honor .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 28 &middot; Location 1087</div><div class='noteText'>You can blunt it by being less of a Rake , asking forgiveness , claiming to have reformed , but this will damage your reputation , making you seem less lovably rakish .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Rake &gt; Page 28 &middot; Location 1088</div><div class='noteText'>In the end , it is better to suffer attacks with dignity and keep on seducing . Seduction is the source of your power ; and you can always count on the infinite indulgence of women .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Ideal Lover &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 1313</div><div class='noteText'>Hint at something for them to aspire to , reveal your faith in some untapped potential you see in them , and you will soon have them eating out of your hand .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Ideal Lover &gt; Page 39 &middot; Location 1325</div><div class='noteText'>They only need the symbol ; they do not really have to worry about re - creating the reality behind it . The good feelings they stir up are enough to ensure a positive response .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Dandy &gt; Page 50 &middot; Location 1594</div><div class='noteText'>if you simply seem socially confident and sure of your taste , people will be drawn to you . The key is to make everything an aesthetic choice . Your ability to alleviate boredom by making life an art will make your company highly prized . The opposite sex is a strange country we can never know ,</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Dandy &gt; Page 52 &middot; Location 1637</div><div class='noteText'>the Dandies ’ charm is that they don’t really care what people think of them .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 57 &middot; Location 1756</div><div class='noteText'>It is important to learn to not react defensively : bend instead of resist , be open to influence from others , and they will more easily fall under your spell .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 61 &middot; Location 1885</div><div class='noteText'>never too late to make other people spoil you . It is all in your attitude . People are drawn to those who expect a lot out of life , whereas they tend to disrespect those who are fearful and undemanding .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 63 &middot; Location 1927</div><div class='noteText'>the role you were given in life is not the role you have to accept . You can always live out a role of your own creation , a role that fits your fantasy . Learn to play with your image , never taking it too seriously . The key is to infuse your play with the conviction and feeling of a child , making it seem natural . The more absorbed you seem in your own joy - filled world , the more seductive you become . Do not go halfway : make the fantasy you inhabit as radical and exotic as possible , and you will attract attention like a magnet .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 65 &middot; Location 1971</div><div class='noteText'>If in a key moment you seem indecisive or self - conscious , the other person will sense that you are thinking of yourself , instead of being overwhelmed by his or her charms . The spell will be broken .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 65 &middot; Location 1974</div><div class='noteText'>It is a matter of rooting out the fear and awkwardness that have built up in you over the years , of becoming more graceful with your approach , less defensive when others seem to resist . Often people’s resistance is a way of testing you , and if you show any awkwardness or hesitation , you not only will fail the test , but you will risk infecting them with your doubts .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Natural &gt; Page 66 &middot; Location 1991</div><div class='noteText'>But if you are uncontrollably childish and cannot turn it off , you run the risk of seeming pathetic , earning not sympathy but pity and disgust .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 70 &middot; Location 2039</div><div class='noteText'>An absence , the declining of an invitation to dinner , an unintentional , unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world . — Marcel Proust</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 71 &middot; Location 2076</div><div class='noteText'>Your greatest power in seduction is your ability to turn away , to make others come after you , delaying their satisfaction . Most people miscalculate and surrender too soon , worried that the other person will lose interest , or that giving the other what he or she wants will grant the giver a kind of power . The truth is the opposite : once you satisfy someone , you no longer have the initiative , and you open yourself to the possibility that he or she will lose interest at the slightest whim . Remember : vanity is critical in love . Make your targets afraid that you may be withdrawing , that you may not really be interested , and you arouse their innate insecurity , their fear that as you have gotten to know them they have become less exciting to you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 71 &middot; Location 2083</div><div class='noteText'>Never be put off by your target’s anger ; it is a sure sign of enslavement .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 73 &middot; Location 2162</div><div class='noteText'>Cold Coquettes create space by remaining elusive and making others pursue them . Their coolness suggests a comfortable confidence that is exciting to be around , even though it may not actually exist ; their silence makes you want to talk . Their self - containment , their appearance of having no need for other people , only makes us want to do things for them , hungry for the slightest sign of recognition and favor .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 73 &middot; Location 2167</div><div class='noteText'>Humans , like nature , hate a vacuum , and emotional distance and silence make them strain to fill up the empty space with words and heat of their own . Like Warhol , stand back and let them fight over you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 74 &middot; Location 2182</div><div class='noteText'>Selfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 74 &middot; Location 2192</div><div class='noteText'>the essence of the Coquette lies not in the tease and temptation but in the subsequent step back , the emotional withdrawal . That is the key to enslaving desire .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 75 &middot; Location 2225</div><div class='noteText'>Self - esteem is critical in seduction . ( Your attitude toward yourself is read by the other person in subtle and unconscious ways . ) Low self - esteem repels , confidence and self - sufficiency attract . The less you seem to need other people , the more likely others will be drawn to you .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 75 &middot; Location 2244</div><div class='noteText'>Remember : obvious flirting will reveal your intentions too clearly . Better to be ambiguous and even contradictory , frustrating at the same time that you stimulate .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 76 &middot; Location 2262</div><div class='noteText'>Coquettes are never jealous — that would undermine their image of fundamental self - sufficiency . But they are masters at inciting jealousy : by paying attention to a third party , creating a triangle of desire , they signal to their victims that they may not be that interested . This triangulation is extremely seductive , in social contexts as well as erotic ones .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Coquette &gt; Page 77 &middot; Location 2282</div><div class='noteText'>The Shadow . It cannot be grasped . Chase your shadow and it will flee ; turn your back on it and it will follow you . It is also a person’s dark side , the thing that makes them mysterious . After they have given us pleasure , the shadow of their withdrawal makes us yearn for their return , much as clouds make us yearn for the sun .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charmer &gt; Page 83 &middot; Location 2374</div><div class='noteText'>Adversity and setbacks actually provide the perfect setting for charm . Showing a calm , unruffled exterior in the face of unpleasantness puts people at ease . You seem patient , as if waiting for destiny to deal you a better card — or as if you were confident you could charm the Fates themselves . Never show anger , ill temper , or vengefulness , all disruptive emotions that will make people defensive . In the politics of large groups , welcome adversity as a chance to show the charming qualities of magnanimity and poise . Let others get flustered and upset — the contrast will redound to your favor . Never whine , never complain , never try to justify yourself .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charmer &gt; Page 85 &middot; Location 2449</div><div class='noteText'>Our personalities are often molded by how we are treated : if a parent or spouse is defensive or argumentative in dealing with us , we tend to respond the same way . Never mistake people’s exterior characteristics for reality , for the character they show on the surface may be merely a reflection of the people with whom they have been most in contact , or a front disguising its own opposite .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charmer &gt; Page 85 &middot; Location 2452</div><div class='noteText'>the key to charm — feeding what has been repressed or denied .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charmer &gt; Page 85 &middot; Location 2455</div><div class='noteText'>Charmers may appear to be weaker than their targets but in the end they are the more powerful side because they have stolen the ability to resist .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charmer &gt; Page 93 &middot; Location 2618</div><div class='noteText'>Never become the slave to your own powers of charm ; keep it under control , something you can turn off and on at will .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 2669</div><div class='noteText'>anyone who has presence , who attracts attention when he or she enters a room , is said to possess charisma .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 2673</div><div class='noteText'>we believe in these people , without having any rational evidence for doing so .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 2675</div><div class='noteText'>Your charisma must seem natural , as if it came from something mysteriously beyond your control , a gift of the gods .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 2676</div><div class='noteText'>there is nothing more seductive than giving people something to believe in and follow .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 98 &middot; Location 2680</div><div class='noteText'>If people believe you have a plan , that you know where you are going , they will follow you instinctively . The direction does not matter : pick a cause , an ideal , a vision and show that you will not sway from your goal . People will imagine that your confidence comes from something real — just as the ancient Hebrews believed Moses was in communion with God , simply because he showed the outward signs .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 99 &middot; Location 2690</div><div class='noteText'>Mystery lies at charisma’s heart , but it is a particular kind of mystery — a mystery expressed by contradiction . The Charismatic may be both proletarian and aristocratic ( Mao Zedong ) , both cruel and kind ( Peter the Great ) , both excitable and icily detached ( Charles de Gaulle ) , both intimate and distant ( Sigmund Freud ) . Since most people are predictable , the effect of these contradictions is devastatingly charismatic . They make you hard to fathom , add richness to your character , make people talk about you . It is often better to reveal your contradictions slowly and subtly — if you throw them out one on top of the other , people may think you have an erratic personality . Show your mysteriousness gradually and word will spread . You must also keep people at arm’s length , to keep them from figuring you out .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 99 &middot; Location 2708</div><div class='noteText'>Saintliness . Most of us must compromise constantly to survive ; saints do not . They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences . The saintly effect bestows charisma .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 100 &middot; Location 2726</div><div class='noteText'>Theatricality . A Charismatic is larger than life , has extra presence . Actors have studied this kind of presence for centuries ; they know how to stand on a crowded stage and command attention . Surprisingly , it is not the actor who screams the loudest or gestures the most wildly who works this magic best , but the actor who stays calm , radiating self - assurance .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 100 &middot; Location 2728</div><div class='noteText'>The effect is ruined by trying too hard .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 101 &middot; Location 2745</div><div class='noteText'>Fervency . You need to believe in something , and to believe in it strongly enough for it to animate all your gestures and make your eyes light up . This cannot be faked . Politicians inevitably lie to the public ; what distinguishes Charismatics is that they believe their own lies , which makes them that much more believable .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 101 &middot; Location 2754</div><div class='noteText'>Vulnerability . Charismatics display a need for love and affection . They are open to their audience , and in fact feed off its energy ; the audience in turn is electrified by the Charismatic , the current increasing as it passes back and forth . This vulnerable side to charisma softens the self - confident side , which can seem fanatical and frightening .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 101 &middot; Location 2764</div><div class='noteText'>Adventurousness . Charismatics are unconventional . They have an air of adventure and risk that attracts the bored . Be brazen and courageous in your actions — be seen taking risks for the good of others . Napoleon made sure his soldiers saw him at the cannons in battle . Lenin walked openly on the streets , despite the death threats he had received . Charismatics thrive in troubled waters ; a crisis situation allows them to flaunt their daring , which enhances their aura .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - The Charismatic &gt; Page 102 &middot; Location 2770</div><div class='noteText'>Show heroism to give yourself a charisma that will last you a lifetime .

To practice it in real life , you need to play the therapist , encouraging people to talk about their childhood . Most of us are only too happy to oblige ; and our memories are so vivid and emotional that a part of us regresses just in talking about our early years . Also , in the course of talking , little secrets slip out : we reveal all kinds of valuable information about our weaknesses and our mental makeup , information you must attend to and remember . Do not take your targets ’ words at face value ; they will often sugarcoat or over - dramatize events in childhood . But pay attention to their tone of voice , to any nervous tics as they talk , and particularly to anything they do not want to talk about , anything they deny or that makes them emotional . Many statements actually mean their opposite : should they say they hated their father , for instance , you can be sure that they are hiding a lot of disappointment — that they actually loved their father only too much , and perhaps never quite got what they wanted from him . Listen closely for recurring themes and stories . Most important , learn to analyze emotional responses and see what lies behind them .</h3>

Finish what is unfinished . Discover what your target never got and you have the ingredients for a deep - rooted seduction .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 17: Effect a Regression &gt; Page 338 &middot; Location 8093</div><div class='noteText'>The Reverse Parental Regression . Here you are the one to regress : you deliberately play the role of the cute , adorable , yet also sexually charged child . Older people always find younger people incredibly seductive . In the presence of youth , they feel a little of their own youth return ; but they are in fact older , and mixed into the invigoration they feel in young people’s company is the pleasure of playing the mother or father to them . If a child has erotic feelings toward a parent , feelings that are quickly repressed , the parent must deal with the same problem in reverse . Assume the role of the child in relation to your targets , however , and they get to act out some of those repressed erotic sentiments . The strategy may seem to call for a difference in age , but this is actually not critical . Marilyn Monroe’s exaggerated little - girl qualities worked just fine on men her age . Emphasizing a weakness or vulnerability on your part will give the target a chance to play the protector .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 17: Effect a Regression &gt; Page 342 &middot; Location 8201</div><div class='noteText'>Keep in mind that certain types are more vulnerable to anoedipal regression . Look for those who , like Professor Mut , seem outwardly the most adult — straitlaced , serious , a little full of themselves . They are struggling to repress their regressive tendencies , overcompensating for their weaknesses . Often those who seem the most in command of themselves are the ripest for regression . In fact they are secretly longing for it , because their power , position , and responsibilities are more a burden than a pleasure .</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - 17: Effect a Regression &gt; Page 347 &middot; Location 8312</div><div class='noteText'>The best and most insidious way to seduce people is often to position yourself as the child . Imagining themselves stronger , more in control , they will be lured into your web . They will feel they have nothing to fear . Emphasize your immaturity , your weakness , and you let them indulge in fantasies of protecting and parenting you — a strong desire as people get older . What they do not realize is that you are getting under their skin , insinuating yourself — it is the child who is controlling the adult . Your innocence makes them want to protect you , but it is also sexually charged . Innocence is highly seductive ; some people even long to play the corrupter of innocence . Stir up their latent sexual feelings and you can lead them astray with the hope of fulfilling a strong yet repressed fantasy : sleeping with the child figure . In your presence , too , they will begin to regress as well , infected by your childish , playful spirit .</h3>

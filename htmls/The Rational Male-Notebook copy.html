        feels powerless and this is a press to commit . This is the point at which you will end up as a “ cheater ” or

        will ever have with any individual woman . You can of course take the coward’s path and just agree to

        present , unspoken understanding that she can ultimately play the pussy card and you’ll comply . While this may
        gratify her in the short term , you will lose her respect in the long term . She wants to be told “ NO ” in

        if he says “ NO ” with the foreknowledge that he knows he won’t be getting any , my sexual powers are devalued .
        ” If her sexual agency is called into question it leaves room for doubt and opens the door once again for
        competition anxiety to creep back in .</h3>

        this regard , but understanding how traditional masculinity has been redefined by social contrivance and
        distilling it back down to its core fundamentals is imperative in getting back to masculinity as a positive . So
        where do you start ? With yourself . You must change your mind about yourself as a “ M ” an and begin thinking
        of yourself as a “ M ” an . The first step is to unlearn what feminized conditioning has taught you to the point
        of it becoming an ego - investment in your personality . You need to become impervious to convenient accusations
        of “ misogyny ” or 1950 ′ s caveman thinking whenever you assert yourself . The truly positive masculine Man
        sets himself apart from the Matrix in spite of a world set against him – this unconscious meta - acknowledgment
        is what makes a woman ( and other men ) attracted to you as a vibrant , responsible , but firmly confident
        masculine Man .</h3>
